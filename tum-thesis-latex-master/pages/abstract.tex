%TODO: Abstract
Union-Find is a classical data structure whose complexity analysis is famously non-trivial. In this thesis we prove the $\alpha$-bound amortized time complexity of an efficient imperative implementation of this data structure. We first revise the history of this emblematic result by Tarjan \cite{Tarjan1975b} and arrive at the modern proof by Alstrup et al. \cite{Alstrup14}.

To reproduce this proof in a formal context within Isabelle/HOL, we first gather the mathematical and technical tools required, most prominently a more comprehensive theory about the Ackermann function than the one already available in the Isabelle/HOL distribution, properties about its inverses, as well as the framework implementing Separation Logic with Time Credits for Imperative/HOL, which already contained a non optimal implementation of this data structure. We then follow closely the work of Chargu√©raud and Pottier \cite{chargueraud17}, which formalized this proof in a similar framework in Coq.

In the end, we prove the asymptotically optimal bound of the operations in an efficient implementation of the Union-Find data structure. The whole proof in Isabelle is available under \cite{Loewenberg2019}. As with any other program in Imperative/HOL, the implementation can be exported to several languages.
