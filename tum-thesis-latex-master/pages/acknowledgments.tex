I want to thank my advisor Maximilian Haslbeck for his infinite patience with me and his invaluable advise. I am very grateful to Dr. Peter Lammich and Simon Wimmer for introducing me to Isabelle and the world of computer-assisted proofs, as well as to Armaël Guéneau for helping me set up Coq.

A very special thank you goes to my father for introducing me to programming when I was a young teenager but especially for his unconditional support.
